1) Inspect the code for quality and readability and documentation.  Identify and implement changes to improve it.

2) Inspect the code and identify a set of unit tests.  Crate a tests subdirectory and implement the unit tests there.

3) In the tests directory, create a unit test that creates a simulated 36 MHz satellite transponder with 10 carriers, and then generates PSDs in 2 days: Using the direct PSD simulation capability, and also generating the IQ data and computing the PSD.  Implement a test that compares these 2 PSDs to ensure they match within sufficient margins.
